Capstone project for WATS 4030

Decided on a bootstrap blog theme and populated the pages with links on the nav bar to be able to move around the page.
Need to add JS to the image gallery as well as my own personal images. (use mouseover/click template from Day at Beach final project)
Need to work on API call in the blog entry so that it reflects the city and/or country in which the entry takes place. (Seattle, Vancouver, Kathmandu, Guangzhou, etc.) - See weather data project from 4010
Figure out how to add Google Map API to blog entries
Add currency API

Received feedback from Becky on the project as well as some useful links on how to incorporate Vue & Bootstrap. Currently trying to figure out how to create a Vue app within a div element on a blog page. Also, want to explore how to use a map as my navigation. Might have to use static images and show my route there as the preview image. May consider removing preview images from blog home page. Not 100% sold on Bootstrap theme. Possible I may change and use a better template. Not sure if I have time to create from base on up. Though this project will be a continuing process as I do need to get these pictures & entries up for sharing with family & friends!

Trying to push images to GitHub. Some were too big. Deleted movies out of folder & re-pushed. Waiting to see if this will work. Researched old projects (refactoring & caching) to see how to use lists & weather app. Lists for the gear page. Weather for all the pages.

Got a little ahead of myself and decided to pretty much destroy the original Bootstrap setup & go with a Vue.js situation as I wanted to be able to get the weather data involved. I also found a way to create a map of my trek with Google Maps and will just need to get that imbedded into the page once I have the basics set up. Fingers crossed I know what I'm doing here ...

STARTING OVER. Oy vey ... It was a disaster and I am starting over. Thank you Becky for your guidance. Seriously, if it wasn't for her, I doubt I would've been able to progress past CSS. 

So now I've created a new Vue app and managed to get a few things going. I've been reviewing our materials from last quarter as a refresher and it's helped. The challenge for me is that I'm trying to do all the things and not focusing on the important parts of what's required to pass. For those of you in the future reading this: JUST FOCUS ON THE REQUIREMENTS. WORRY ABOUT THE PRETTY LATER. Translation: DON'T DO WHAT I'VE DONE.
