      </li>
      <li>
        <img src="../assets/IMG7863.jpg" alt="plane1"/>
        <br />We're on a very small plane.
      </li>
      <li>
        <img src="../assets/IMG7864.jpg" alt="plane2"/>
        <br />Whoa. Is that the cockpit?!? 
      </li>
      <li>
        <img src="../assets/IMG7866.jpg" alt="prop"/>
        <br />Yes the plane is a little twin prop job. Not for the faint of heart.
      </li>
      <li>
        <img src="../assets/IMG7868.jpg" alt="begin"/>
        <br />We survived the world's most dangerous airport & got a quick safety briefing so off we go
      </li>
      <li>
        <img src="../assets/IMG7871.jpg" alt="me1"/>
        <br />In a state of disbelief that this is really happening. That's the Dudh Kosi river. The water comes from the glaciers of Everest. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <img src="../assets/IMG7885.jpg" alt="handle"/>
        <br />Even the bathroom door handles are pretty here.
      </li>
      <li>
        <img src="../assets/IMG7887.jpg" alt="view1"/>
        <br />The morning view from my room. Wow!
      </li>
      <li>
        <img src="../assets/IMG7895.jpg" alt="view2"/>
        <br />We stopped here for a little tea & rest. The views do not disappoint.
      </li>
      <li>
        <img src="../assets/IMG7899.jpg" alt="park"/>
        <br />Stopping to check into the park. Everyone has to show their passport & proof that they paid to be there. Also, you're not allowed in without a guide. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <img src="../assets/IMG7905.jpg" alt="bridge1"/>
        <br />Yep. We're going across that. No, not the lower one. The higher & longer one. If you have a fear of heights, this one will scare you. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <img src="../assets/IMG7908.jpg" alt="bridge2"/>
        <br />And. Here. We. Go!
      </li>
      <li>
        <img src="../assets/IMG7911.jpg" alt="bridge3"/>
        <br />Holy cow that was intense! Oh and did I mention you can't be on the bridge at the same time when animals are crossing? There was a donkey train behind us so we had to pick up the pace a little. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <img src="../assets/IMG7919.jpg" alt="NB1"/>
        <br />I finally made it to Namche Bazaar and believe I experienced all four seasons in the last 8-10 hours. I'm now at 11,500 feet above sea level.
      </li>

      <li>
        <img src="../assets/IMG7926.jpg" alt="NB2"/>
        <br />Rest day in Namche Bazaar and our first little peek at Everest herself. Here she's being shy but you can still see her. Started the diamox today as last night I felt the first effects of altitude.
      </li>
      <li>
        <img src="../assets/IMG7948.jpg" alt="bar2"/>
        <br />The highest bar in the world and of course it's an Irish one. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <img src="../assets/IMG7955.jpg" alt="view2"/>
        <br />These mountains and clouds are so beautiful. Words are impossible here.
      </li>
      <li>
        <img src="../assets/IMG7958.jpg" alt="flags"/>
        <br />The weather can change on you quickly & without warning so you must be prepared for anything at all times.
      </li>
      <li>
        <img src="../assets/IMG7962.jpg" alt="me2"/>
        <br />Taking a moment to pause & reflect on that I'm really here in the Nepalese Himalayas seeing some of the highest mountains in the world. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <img src="../assets/IMG7973.jpg" alt="gate2"/>
        <br />In Tengboche and the monastery is the highest in the world. John & Chris Berlow getting a brothers selfie for the wives back home.
      </li>
      <li>
        <img src="../assets/IMG7977.jpg" alt="views3"/>
        <br />The evening in Tengboche did not disappoint. But as we climb higher, we get further & further away from the tree line. Soon it will be nothing but rocks & dirt.
      </li>
      <li>
        <img src="../assets/IMG7987.jpg" alt="views4"/>
        <br />Good morning, Mt. Everest! That's the jet stream blowing snow off her peak. 
      </li>

      <li>
        <img src="../assets/IMG7999.jpg" alt="me4"/>
        <br />Definitely above the tree line now. And still more miles to go.
      </li>
      <li>
        <img src="../assets/IMG8003.jpg" alt="views5"/>
        <br />I can't get enough of how beautiful it is up here.
      </li>
      <li>
        <img src="../assets/IMG8014.jpg" alt="me5"/>
        <br />On our way from Lobuche to EBC! 
      </li>
      <li>
        <img src="../assets/IMG8016.jpg" alt="pants"/>
        <br />Wearing the fancy pants for a momentous occasion.
      </li>
      <li>
        <img src="../assets/IMG8022.jpg" alt="views6"/>
        <br />Walking along the glacier. Everest is the peak in the distance.
      </li>
      <li>
        <img src="../assets/IMG8027.jpg" alt="EBC1"/>
        <br />I DID IT!!! 17,600 feet above sea level! 
      </li>
      <!-- <li>

      <li>
        <img src="../assets/IMG8042.jpg" alt="descent1"/>
        <br />Now begins the long trek back and into lower elevations and more oxygen. I can already feel my lungs working better and my body absorbing all the oxygen it's accumulating.
      </li>

      <li>
        <img src="../assets/IMG8048.jpg" alt="descent2"/>
        <br />Pheriche to Namche Bazaar. You can tell we're descending because LOOK! Green plants!!!
      </li>
      <li>
        <img src="../assets/IMG8055.jpg" alt="descent3"/>
        <br />Our last day of trekking from Namche Bazaar to Lukly and Everest offers us one last lovely view of her majestic presence
      </li>
      <li>
        <img src="../assets/IMG8061.jpg" alt="lukla"/>
        <br />And we're under 10,000 feet elevation. Hi Lukla. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <img src="../assets/IMG8062.jpg" alt="flag"/>
        <br />Having a celebratory beer at the local pub in Lukla. I loved this flag & signed my name on the wall. 
      </li>

      <li>
        <img src="../assets/IMG8069.jpg" alt="gorp"/>
        <br />Time for shenanigans, Gorp the Yeti, and really bad whisky. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <img src="../assets/IMG8096.jpg" alt="meKTM"/>
        <br />It's my birthday and time to leave Nepal. I'm sad to leave but also super proud of the achievement I accomplished. Already thinking about my trip back to Nepal.
