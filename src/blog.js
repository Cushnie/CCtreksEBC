        'entry': "I had a late night flight out of Seattle to Vancouver, BC where I discovered that if your flight has more than a 12-hour layover, you do not get to stay in the international gated security area. Your bags can stay but you get the pleasure of hanging out in the ticketing area. Only because I did not have a boarding pass for my next flight. There went that hope of sleeping next to the Vancouver Aquarium display. Yes I wanted to sleep with the fishes. so off to the ticketing area outside of security I went. Somehow I managed to catch a nap here, a nap there. The longest stretch of a nap I caught was probably 45 minutes at the most. And even then, I could be totally off base. Nonetheless, I really don't like sleeping airports. But I wasn't alone. Now I'm having my first ever Tim Horton's donuts and coffee (When in Canada ... ) and waiting for the ticket counter to open so I can get my boarding pass and get through to security. This is already shaping up to the be journey of a lifetime."

I literally cannot see straight. The flight has been a good one and the person originally sitting in the middle seat moved somewhere else so I didn't have someone next to me for most of the flight. #winning Watched some Disney movies - 'Brave' and 'Coco' ... was NOT ready for the tears on that last one. oof. Some observations about my flight - the windows have purple & blue hues on them and made it look like we were flying later than we really were. Noticed that the head flight attendant is wearing a body cam much like our police officers do. (eek!) According to the map displayed, we flew REEEEAAAALLLLYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY close to North Korea. (not gonna like, I got a bit nervous then) Oh hey we're landing. 6:54pm - got through security here in China. Very crowded & no personal space boundaries recognized. It's wayyyy humid here, kinda like the American South, and LOOK! a Starbucks!!! I shouldn't be surprised but I am. Now let's go find my gate and prep for another 4.5 hours from China to Nepal."

(1) If you come here, bring a buff or bandana - the air quality is not great at all. *cough cough* (2) Don't drink the water, buy only bottled water. (enviornmentalism is a thing here but for us delicate Westerners, you almost have to put it aside & recognize a trip to the hospital may not be worth chancing it) (3) They drive on the left hand side of the road and you play the human form of Frogger every time you cross the road. (4) Hinduism is the main religion here so there are cows everywhere and they do kinda rule the streets. "
